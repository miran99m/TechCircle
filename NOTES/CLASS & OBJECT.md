CLASS & OBJECT

- A class is a blueprint for creating objects, while an object is an instance of a class.

- A class can have one or more fields or variables, which are used to store data, and methods, which are used to perform actions or operations.

- To create an object, you need to use the new keyword followed by the class name and any arguments required by the constructor.

- Each object created from a class has its own set of instance variables and can call its own set of methods.

- Classes can be organized into packages, which help to group related classes together.

- Access modifiers (public, private, protected) can be used to control the visibility and accessibility of class members.

CLASS & OBJECT

- A class is a blueprint for creating objects, while an object is an instance of a class.

- A class can have one or more fields or variables, which are used to store data, and methods, which are used to perform actions or operations.

- To create an object, you need to use the new keyword followed by the class name and any arguments required by the constructor.

- Each object created from a class has its own set of instance variables and can call its own set of methods.

- Classes can be organized into packages, which help to group related classes together.


ACCESS MODIFER
- Java has four access modifiers: public, protected, default (also known as package-private), and private.
- can be used to control the visibility and accessibility of class members.
The public access modifier makes a class member accessible from anywhere in the program. It can be accessed by other classes, packages, and even outside the application.

The protected access modifier makes a class member accessible to the same class, its subclasses, and classes in the same package.

The default (package-private) access modifier makes a class member accessible only within the same package. It is not accessible outside the package.

The private access modifier makes a class member accessible only within the same class. It is not accessible outside the class.


ENCAPSULATION

Encapsulation is a mechanism of wrapping data and code into a single unit, which is known as a class.

The main purpose of encapsulation is to protect the data from outside interference and misuse.

Encapsulation provides a way to hide the implementation details of an object from the outside world and only expose what is necessary.

Public methods are used to access and modify private data members of a class. These methods are also called getters and setters.
